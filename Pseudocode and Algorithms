### **Task 2: Add three numbers without using the plus operator.**


START

INPUT  n1
INPUT  n2
INPUT  n3

SET sum TO 0

WHILE n1 > 0 DO
    sum = sum + 1
    n1 = n1 – 1
ENDWHILE


WHILE n2 > 0 DO
    sum = sum + 1
    n2 = n2 – 1
ENDWHILE

WHILE n3 > 0 DO
    sum = sum + 1
    n3 = n3 – 1
ENDWHILE


OUTPUT  “The sum is: %d”, sum

END


### **Task 3: Make a simple calculator that does ‘+’ and ‘-’ operations.**

START 

INPUT number1 
INPUT operator  
INPUT number2 

SET result to 0 


IF operator == '+'  THEN 
	SET result to number1 + number2 
ELSE IF operator == '-'  THEN 
	SET result to number1 - number2 
ELSE 
	PRINT "Invalid operator" 
END IF 

PRINT "The result is:", result 

END


## Objective 3

### **Task 1: Determine if N is a divisor of n and identify its even or odd.**

    1. Ask the user to input a number for N.
    2. Ask the user to input a number for n.
    3. Determine if dividing n by N leaves a remainder.
    4. If there is no remainder, confirm that N divides n.
    5. If remainder of N is 0, then N is even
    6. Else classify it as odd.
    7. Inform the user whether N is a divisor of n.
    8. Inform the user whether N is even or odd.
    9. Conclude the process.

### **Task 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)**

    1. Input first number
    2. Input the operator (+, -, *, /, %, //)
    3. Input the second number
    4. if operator is ‘+’, sum the numbers and return result.
    5. if operator is ‘-’, subtract the numbers and return result.
    6. if operator is ‘*’, multiply the numbers and return result.
    7. if operator is ‘/’, divide the numbers and return result.
    8. if operator is ‘%’, return the remainder of division.
    9. if operator is ‘//’, return the whole integer of the division.
    10. Display the result
    11. End the process.
